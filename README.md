Directions:

The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors. A survey is administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). You have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis on the survey dataset that is provided. Your analysis will inform the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset), so that they can focus their recruiting efforts in those areas that are successful, particularly for under-represented groups.

Complete:

In this assignment you will complete the first step of all data science projects, which is to determine the data science questions you want to answer with the given dataset. 

Dataset Assignment: If your Student ID number ends in an odd digit, you are assigned to work on the Majors Survey.  If your Student ID number ends in an even digit, you are assigned to work on the Non-Majors Survey. 

1. First, review the questions asked in your assigned survey.

2. Given these survey questions and possible answers, what information would be helpful for the IT department to know in order to achieve their goal of increasing enrollment in their majors?

Brainstorm some data science questions that could help achieve the departmental goals of increasing enrollment by learning about their current students. 

*Note that you are not creating new survey questions (the surveys exist already), you are creating questions that you will answer through your data analysis. 

Also make sure that your questions can be answered by the dataset generated from the survey.  For example, you wouldn't have a question that asked what the top 5 hometowns were, since students are not asked what their hometown was. 

3.  Record your best five questions in the assignment submission box provided below.
