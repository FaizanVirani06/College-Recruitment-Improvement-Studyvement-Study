Directions:

The CCM Department of Information Technologies seeks to improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors. A survey was administered every Fall semester for entry-level computing classes and computer literacy courses (for non-majors). I have been tasked to perform exploratory data analysis on the survey dataset that is provided. My analysis will inform the department about which/when/where/why students are taking their classes (as indicated in the survey dataset), so that they can focus their recruiting efforts in those areas that are successful, particularly for under-represented groups.

My data and analysis will answer the following questions:

  Compare the gender demographics of the survey over time (2020-2023).  What are the changes over time, if any?
  What were the top reasons why students enrolled in a computing course? Show a bar chart of this field, sort from highest to lowest.
  Which computing classes are non-majors most interested in?
  What age group is most likely to enroll in computing classes?
